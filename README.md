# Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Via Cross Distillation Based on State Space Model
# Introduction
The proposed CDA is a knowledge distillation model for anomaly detection in industrial images. Its main components are as follows: a pre-trained teacher encoder (https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07146) and a MAMBA-based (https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752) student decoder.
The main process of CDA is shown in the figure below.
